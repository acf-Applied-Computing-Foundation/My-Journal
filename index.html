        <h1>My Favorite Song, On Autoplay- 08/31/2022</h1>
        <p>
          Today was full of small happy miracles! To state that one miracle
          which really made my day, there was this one song by Ellie Goulding
          that I used to listen to on loop in my high school days. Today, while
          I was working out, I actually thought about this song randomly.
          Believe it or not, it has been more than five years since I last
          listened to this song and yet randomly enough, Spotify played just
          this number for me on radio. Is this magic, or can AI finally read our
          minds now? Anyway, it made my day.

          The song actually reminded me of this fictional character that I
          fangirled.

        <h1>Dancing By Myself- 09/01/2022</h1>
        <p>
          There was a city-wide powercut today, and in this excuse, I took some
          time off from my laptop and smartphone and went to the rooftop for a
          nice one-hour long walk. The moon was out, and so were the stars. The
          lack of city lights made it look even more beautiful. It was then that
          I noticed my shadow, look somewhat eery and large on the wall- I took
          this time to dance by myself, with my shadow.

        <h1>Dreaming About Food- 09/02/2022</h1>
        <p>
          Today started off kind of weird, when I had a dream very early in the
          morning that I was eating pizza in my sleep. It was very cheesy and
          had lots of onions and mushroom for toppings- so yum but then, I woke
          up right before I could savour it. Pretty much then, I realized that
          it was actually time for me to go to the gym instead. What a sad
          reality check. :( Later on, I also ran for five extra minutes on the
          treadmill.
